# 🎮 Four in a Row (Connect Four) – Python CLI Game
A simple, interactive, and user-friendly command-line (CLI) version of the classic Connect Four game for two players, written in Python.

## 📖 About The Project

**Four in a Row (Connect Four)** is a classic two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This project is a **CLI-based Python implementation** of the game, designed for local two-player fun and learning. All interaction happens through the terminal or command prompt.
